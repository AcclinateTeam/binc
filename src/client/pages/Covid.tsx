We wanted to get black and brown people to consider, not just the effects of COVID-19. But their overall health issues were at a higher morbidity rate. Due to the fact that we had underlying conditions. We saw a need to try to get our people to start being more proactive about their health. Partnerships are key to this process. This is a work that has been strategically done, the Jefferson County Department of Health over time. But I think it's important for us to understand the multifaceted roles that they play in our community, as it pertains to the health of black and brown people. When you come into the Jefferson County Department of Health. You shouldn't come in just expecting to be vaccinated. You ought to come in with a mindset that I want to really take control of my health.</p>
